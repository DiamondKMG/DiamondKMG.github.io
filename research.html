									<p>As baby goby fish migrate upstream they must evade other fish that want to eat them. This study found that when the water in streams is flowing quickly, the gobies are less likley to try to escape a predator's attack. This is espeically true when predators attack in the same direction as stream water is flowing!</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Habitat use in desert lizards</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/lizard.png" alt="northern leopard lizard with brown and orange spots" /></a>
									<p>This collaborative project looked at habitat use differences in lizards that use different strategies to find prey but inhabit the same patch of desert. We were interested to see if our active foraging western whiptail lizards (<i>Aspidoscelis tigris</i>) moved through their shared habitat differently than out ambush foraging leopard lizards (<i>Gambelia wislizenii</i>). Along the way we talked about graduate school and the life of a field biologists among many other aspects of the field we all adore! I am so grateful for Maria and Doug Eifler and for the Erell Institute in allowing me to participate in this project!</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Covariation of behavior <br>& locomotor performance </a></h2>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/curlytail.png" alt="baby curly-tail lizard" /></a>
									<p>As an REU student I was part of a team that examined if field display behavior could be used as an honest signal in the northern curly tailed-lizard, <i>Leiocephalus carinatus</i>. We collected field display rates from focal observations as well as endurance trials using a custom built treadmill. We found that both field display rate and endurance are repeatable within individual lizards. We also found a correlation between field display rate and endurance at the individual level. These results suggest that display frequency may be an honest signal of endurance in males of this species.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Evolutionary relationships of pitvipers</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/rattlesnake.png" alt="eastern diamondback rattlesnake" /></a>
									<p>We were able to resolve evolutionary relationships of 39 species of rattlesnakes using a combination of mitochondrial, nuclear, and phenotypic characters. Overall our results were similar to previous (mainly molecular) phylogenies, with the exception of a few historically hard to place species. However, by using the combination of molecular and morphological characters that were used in this study, we were able to place 3 species in a new species group, the long tailed species group. While future work will continue to resolve relationships among rattlesnake species, this project introduced a naive freshman to what science really is. I have no idea where I would be now if it were not for Dr. Christopher L. Parkinson and Dr. Allyson M Fenwick, but I am SO grateful for their allowing me to work on this project for it is the reason I do research. </p>
