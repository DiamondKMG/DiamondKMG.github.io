									<h2>We are a group of consistently curious humans who enjoy using math to ask questions about the living world. We are most interested in why animals are shaped in such strange ways and how these shapes influence how animals move. We mainly work on animals that have scales, such as lizards and fishes. If you have any questions that you think we could help answer please reach out! From debating hypothetical animal matchups to figuring out how to use techniques from math and physics to quantify animal shape and motions, we love talking all kinds of science!</h2>

												<h4>Kelly Diamond, Principal Investigator (diamondk@rhodes.edu)</h4>
												<p>I am an integrative biologist who cares more about the people I work with than the questions we develop or data we analyze. I have worked with teams to study how different groups of rattlesnakes are related to eachother, how different environmental factors effect the migration of a group of waterfall-climbing fishes, and to develop methods for automating the collection of shape data on 2D and 3D images of fishes.</p> 
												<p>At Rhodes I aim to curate research collaborations that allow the students I work with to gain a better understanding of the different types of careers they can pursue in interdiciplinary science. When not on campus you can find me playing outside with my partner and our pup. We particulary enjoy camping, paddling, and clibing rocks!</p>

										<h2>Community</h2>

									<h2>Community Statement</h2>
									<p>The questions we ask as scientists are inspired by what we as humans have seen, read, and learned from those around us. This fact makes the process of science inherently biased by our lived experiences. I attempt to combat biases by collaborating with people from different backgrounds and from different parts of the world, who do not share my current world view. As a student I was trained to learn not only the natural history of the species I study, but also their cultural significance, and to collaborate with local experts when developing research questions and experiments. My goal as an educator and a researcher is to create an environment where people from all backgrounds, identities, and cultures feel safe and welcome to ask questions and work together to search for answers. <br> 
<br> 
I put extensive effort into making sure my students feel comfortable asking me questions. In addition to making a conscious effort to use language that is as inclusive as possible, I encourage students to let me know when my intentions and their interpretation of my wording do not align. Another way I aim to create a safe space is through conversations about mental health. We are people that do science, not machines. Learning how to balance work, research, learning, and personal endeavors is part of the scientific process and I aim to create the space to allow the humans I work with to learn what balance works best for them. <br> 
<br> 
Ensuring all students feel comfortable asking questions is an important first step towards creating the space for diverse students to feel welcome in science. However, my job as a mentor is to go beyond making students feel welcome, and to remove any barrier I can for the students I work with so that they can focus on their science. I have developed a <a href="agreement.pdf">student agreement</a> for all students I work with that explains my expectations for them and what they can expect from me as a mentor. Within this document I lay out my commitment to lift up voices that have been historically excluded from science and provide mechanisms for calling me out if I say or do anything that they feel is disrespectful to themselves or others in any way.<br> 
 <br> 
I am passionate about reaching out to the broader community, especially in communities where education more frequently occurs on the job rather than in the classroom. Some of the projects geared toward community members that I have worked include helping found the Science Outreach Team at Clemson University, which developed science-themed activities for community events. Through the Skype a Scientist program, I have been able to show students from around the world what a scientist looks like and how they too can become a scientist. Most recently, I started <a href="https://www.askananimalscientist.com/">AskAnAnimalScientist.com</a> , which aims to enable people to ask questions about any and all animals, to which I or my collaborator respond with short, kid-friendly responses with links to learn more. I am actively looking for programs to collaborate with, especially with Memphis-based organizations. If you would like to collaborate, please reach out!

                  <h2>Lab Community Policies</h2>
                  <p>The humans that work in the lab are more important the questions we ask, data we collect, or results we present. Working with the Shape and Scales Lab requires mutual respect for ALL members of the lab. This means: <br> 
<b>1. Ask.</b> If you have a question, ask. <br> 
<b>2.	Let others know what you need. </b>Communication is the most important skill you need to learn in science. It is also how we ensure we are giving everyone the respect we strive for. <br> 
<b>3.	Value team members because of the different viewpoints they bring to the lab. </b><br> 
<b>4.	Listen and appreciate different perspectives. </b> Especially when you do not agree. <br> 
<b>5.	Refer to every person in the lab the way they wish to be referred. </b>If you make a mistake, apologize, and make a conscious effort to give more respect in the future. <br> 
<b>6.	Speak up.</b> Let people know when someone does something that you feel excludes or discriminates against you or another human for any component of their identity. <br> 
<b>7.	Be flexible.</b> There are many aspects of our lives we do not have control over, be willing to modify timelines or adjust expectations as life happens. <br> 
<b>8.	Give credit where credit is due.</b> We are constantly building on the work of those who came before us and those we are currently collaborating with. The best way to build a good network is to ensure we link all of the ideas that have allowed the research we present to be done.
